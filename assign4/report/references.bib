	abstract     = {Anomalies are data points that are few and different. As a result of these properties, we show that anomalies are susceptible to a mechanism called isolation. This article proposes a method called Isolation Forest (iForest), which detects anomalies purely based on the concept of isolation without employing any distance or density measure---fundamentally different from all existing methods. As a result, iForest is able to exploit subsampling (i) to achieve a low linear time-complexity and a small memory-requirement and (ii) to deal with the effects of swamping and masking effectively. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest outperforms ORCA, one-class SVM, LOF, and Random Forests in terms of AUC, processing time, and robustness against masking and swamping effects. iForest also works well in high-dimensional problems containing a large number of irrelevant attributes, and when anomalies are not available in the training sample.},
